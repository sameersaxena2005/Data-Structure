Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.

Mutable data types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).
Immutable data types cannot be changed (e.g., strings, tuples).

EXAMPLE:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # Allowed (mutable)

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple[0] = 10  # Error (immutable)
